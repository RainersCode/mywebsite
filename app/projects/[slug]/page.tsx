    fullDescription: "This project involves the development of a comprehensive website for a rugby club, designed to serve both public supporters and internal administrators. The primary goal is to create an engaging, modern, and mobile-responsive public-facing website showcasing club information (articles, fixtures, galleries, team details, contacts) while providing a secure and intuitive admin portal for easy content management. The website follows design principles from v0.dev and utilizes the CodeGuide Starter Lite boilerplate for structure.",

    challenge: "The main challenge is to empower the rugby club with a dynamic online presence that is easy to update for non-technical admin staff. The club needed a reliable way to keep supporters informed with timely news, match schedules, and other content, replacing potentially outdated or cumbersome processes. This required a solution that balanced a professional, modern public interface with a secure, user-friendly backend for content management.",
    solution: "We are building a web application using Next.js 14 with the App Router structure. The solution comprises two core components: a visually appealing public website built with Shadcn UI components for displaying club content, and a secure admin portal accessible via Clerk Auth for content management. The backend is powered by Supabase, providing a PostgreSQL database, real-time capabilities for instant content updates, and API endpoints. Integration with the Facebook API allows for seamless sharing of articles."
